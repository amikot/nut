RIELLO_USB(8)
=============

NAME
----

riello_usb - Driver for Riello UPS Protocol UPS equipment via USB

SYNOPSIS
--------

*riello_usb* -h

*riello_usb* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
riello_usb driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

riello_usb supports all recent Riello UPS with USB.

Older Riello UPS products are not supported.


EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

You may need to tweak some settings, depending on the make and model of your UPS
(see linkman:ups.conf[5]):

*localcalculation*::
When enabled, driver will calculate values of `battery.runtime` and `battery.charge`
locally. This is for some Riello models (iPlug and iDialog series) that provide
incorrect values. Local calculation is done according to nominal battery capacity,
nominal battery voltage, actual battery charge, maximum and actual UPS load.
+
Lead battery charge graph is not linear, so guesstimated charge value may not be
perfectly accurate. However it should be good enough to determine battery
actual status and roughly estimate the time it can power the system.
